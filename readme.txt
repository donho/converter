NppConvert is a plugin for Notepad++ that allows you to convert selected text between ASCII and hexadecimal formats. You can choose to convert a hexadecimal string to ASCII or an ASCII string to hexadecimal, depending on your needs.

To customize the format of the generated hex string, you can modify the parameters in the [ascii2Hex] section of the converter.ini file. Note that you need to restart Notepad++ for the changes to take effect.

NppConvert is also capable of detecting the input hex string format for the “Hex -> ASCII” command, making it easier to use.

In addition to conversion, this plugin provides a conversion panel that can be useful when you need to convert a value into ASCII, decimal, hexadecimal, octal, or binary.

This plugin is licensed under GPL.
